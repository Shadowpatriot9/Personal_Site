Features to add:
- Hover action where the sectiontitle gets animated highlighted
- when looking at projects section, the whole site focuses on it and dims out the others until scrolled back up or mouse hover is over it
- aka, more theatrics and animations to make it look pretty
- better splash screen and maybe a rolling continuous animation on the title bar with mouse hover action of mgs to show full name(?)
