I was intrigued by the size of the station that I started to think about how it would be built and more importantly, how \n          it could be built practically.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          After much thought, I came to an idea that we (as a species) needed a better way to obtain materials which led to an idea of creating a duplicator machine (yes, like in Star Trek lol).\n          After briefly drafting it, I quickly noticed the scope of the project and narrowed it down to the concept of simply concerting a base element into another.\n          Water was chosen as the ideal input primarily due to two reasons. 1. It's the most abundant resource on the planet and 2. It's a simple molecule to break down.\n          Then once the idea was finalized, it was off to the races of concepts and designs. 😀\n        </section>\n        {/* Section | Concept */}\n        <section className=\"section\" id=\"concept\">\n          <h3> Concept: </h3>\n          Core: \n          <li></li>\n          Sub: \n          <li></li>\n        </section>  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </main>\n  {/* Footer */}\n  <footer> \n    {/* Copyright */}\n    <div className=\"graphic\">\n      <p> © 2024 Grayden Scovil </p> \n    </div>\n    {/* Love Note */}\n    <div className=\"love-note\">\n      <p> Made with ♥ </p>\n    </div>  \n  </footer>\n</div>\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Naton;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,SAASC,IAAI,QAAQ,kBAAkB;AACvC;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAEA,SAASC,KAAKA,CAAA,EAAI;EAChB,oBACED,OAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,gBAGFF,OAAA;MAAMG,OAAO,EAAC,OAAO;MAACC,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;MAACC,OAAO,EAAC;IAAuC;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAExFT,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAO;IAAO;MAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAO,CAAC,eAEtBT,OAAA;MAAMU,GAAG,EAAC,YAAY;MAACC,IAAI,EAAC;IAAY;MAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAG3CT,OAAA;MAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;MAACC,EAAE,EAAC;IAAS;MAAAP,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAGxCT,OAAA;MAAQa,EAAE,EAAC,QAAQ;MAAAX,QAAA,eACnBF,OAAA,CAACF,IAAI;QAACgB,EAAE,EAAC,GAAG;QAAAZ,QAAA,eACVF,OAAA;UAAQa,EAAE,EAAC,QAAQ;UAAAX,QAAA,EAAC;QAAE;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAQ;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAC3B;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACC,CAAC,eAETT,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,eACEF,OAAA;QAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAV,QAAA,gBAExBF,OAAA;UAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;UAAAV,QAAA,gBAErBF,OAAA;YAASa,EAAE,EAAC,OAAO;YAAAX,QAAA,eACjBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;YAAO;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACT,CAAC,eAEVT,OAAA;YAASY,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAACC,EAAE,EAAC,OAAO;YAAAX,QAAA,gBACrCF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,GAAI,gBAAc,eAAAF,OAAA;gBAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;cAA2B;gBAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAG,CAAC,KAAC;YAAA;cAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1DT,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;YAAwD;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI,CAAC,ysBAQjE,eAAAT,OAAA;cAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;cAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAK,CAAC,k7BASR;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAS,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACP,CAAC,eAENT,OAAA;UAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;UAAAV,QAAA,gBAErBF,OAAA;YAASY,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAACC,EAAE,EAAC,YAAY;YAAAX,QAAA,gBAC1CF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;YAAa;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI,CAAC,6vBAOtB,eAAAT,OAAA;cAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;cAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAK,CAAC,wlBAKR;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAS,CAAC,eAEVT,OAAA;YAASY,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAACC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAX,QAAA,gBACvCF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;YAAU;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI,CAAC,SAEnB,eAAAT,OAAA;cAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAQ,CAAC,QAET,eAAAT,OAAA;cAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAQ,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACF,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACP,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACF,CAAC,eAEPT,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,gBAEEF,OAAA;QAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;QAAAV,QAAA,eACtBF,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAAuB;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAC3B,CAAC,eAENT,OAAA;QAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAV,QAAA,eACxBF,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAAa;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACjB,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACA,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACN,CAAC;AAGN;AAACM,EAAA,GA/FQd,KAAK;AAiGd,eAAeA,KAAK;AAAC,IAAAc,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
