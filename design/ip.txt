Bugs:
- fix features header to left more
- make sure all grids are same px for home grids of main and s9

In Progress | Main:
- general optmization and cleanup

- Hover action where the sectiontitle gets animated highlighted
- when looking at projects section, the whole site focuses on it and dims out the others until scrolled back up or mouse hover is over it
- aka, more theatrics and animations to make it look pretty
- better splash screen and maybe a rolling continuous animation on the title bar with mouse hover action of mgs to show full name(?)
- add the follwing as projects:
- for the about, keep it to just brief "yo, here my site. I like to keep it simple so here you go, if you want to look at my resume and stuff, start clicking, I didnt want to have the same thing in 20 different locations (GH, LI, etc...)

In Progress | Page | S9:
- refactor html where title is main grid then the sections below are another grid in columns
- better header design (color?)
- real time monitoring dashboard connected to s9?
- want to showcase specs w/some style

Done | Page | S9:
- make a whole fade page where once the page is accessed that the whole page like inverts in a fade animation to then load the needed site!!
- link back to home in header
- carry the home footer over
- want it to include features of s9
- want similar format to home but want s9 header to be inverted
